# Active User Access Tracking

This project:

1. Tracks the pool of DST access granted by SI DST admin within the SI staff.
2. Tracks the pool of DST access granted by SI DST admin, but no longer in SI staff.
3. Send automatic email to "Non-SI DST users" to confirm that they are using DST for SI related research.
